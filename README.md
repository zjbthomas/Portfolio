# Portfolio
Welcome to my project showcase! This repository serves as a central hub for exploring the tools, scripts, and projects I have developed.

## üéÆ Toy Arcade (Games)

***A collection of fun games I have built.***

- [DukeChess](https://github.com/zjbthomas/DukeChess): a digital adaptation of the chess-inspired board game "The Duke".
    - **Highlighted features**: AI opponent, cross-platform multiplayer support (desktop & web).
    - **Tech stack**: Godot (desktop); React & JavaScript (front-end); Java, Node.js & WebSocket/socket.io (back-end).
- [MemoryDungeon](https://github.com/zjbthomas/MemoryDungeon): an enhanced version of the traditional memory game, with a roguelike gameplay experience.
    - **Highlighted **features**: AI opponent, heroes with unique abilities, and gacha mechanics.
    - **Tech stack**: Godot & Qt in C++ (desktop).
- [LinkWord](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LinkWord): a minimal Chinese word-chain game.
    - **Tech stack**: Python.

## üî¨ Research Corner

***A selection of my most meaningful research projects.***

- [UBCBench](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench): a set of benchmarks for analyzing Android static taint analysis tools (paper available [here](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts/2022/10/09529015/1wB2FS12ld6)). Contributions to these tools were accepted by their original authors (details [here](https://resess.github.io/artifacts/StaticTaint/ubcbench/#fixed-bugs)).
- [ShallowDeepFakesLocalization](https://github.com/zjbthomas/ShallowDeepFakesLocalization): a deep learning solution that can effectively identify modified regions in fake images (paper available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074246)).
- [TMO-GAN](https://github.com/zjbthomas/TMO-GAN): a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to produce 4K High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, significantly
improving perceptual quality (paper available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10074176)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Toy Workshop (Scripts)

***Handy scripts I have crafted to make life easier.***

Some userscripts for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), built using **JavaScript**:
- [Userscript](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/SteamLanguage) to highlight Steam games in a user's wishlist if they do not support certain languages.
    - Language information is retrieved using **Python** script [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker/blob/main/steam_language.py) as a workflow in **Github Actions**. 
    - A Google Chrome extension version is also available [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LanguageInfo).
- [Userscript](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/ICBC) to automatically book road tests on Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) website.
- [Userscript](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/blob/main/Arknights/yituliu-store.user.js) to annotate redeemed events' in-game resources for a popular third-party support website for the Arknights mobile game.

Some tiny scripts based on **Python**:
- [SteamOnlineChecker](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker): a tool using **Github Actions** to automatically monitor the status of a Steam user and send updates as Telegram messages.
- [PRTS-Scraper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/PRTS-Scraper): a tiny tool to scrape skill icons from the Arknights mobile game using MediaWiki APIs. These icons can later be used to train AI image generators to create new ones.

Some modifications on other tools:
- [web-clipper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/web-clipper): I contributed to this Google Chrome extension that supports webpage clipping for popular note-taking apps (e.g., OneNote and Notion) by adding support for OneNote note groups. The [pull request](https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/pull/950) was merged by the original author.
