# Portfolio
Welcome to my project showcase! This repository serves as a central hub for exploring the 🎮 games, 🛠️ scripts, and 🔬 research projects I have developed.

## 🎮 Toy Arcade (Games)

| 🔤**LinkWord** |  | Lightweight Chinese word-chain game |  | Python |

## 🛠️ Toy Workshop (Scripts)

***Handy scripts I have crafted to make life easier.***

### 🐵 Tampermonkey Userscripts (JavaScript) 
- [Steam Wishlist Language Highlighter](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/SteamLanguage): highlights games in a user's Steam wishlist that lack support for specific languages.
    - Language information is retrieved using a **Python** script [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker/blob/main/steam_language.py) as a **GitHub Actions** workflow. 
    - A Google Chrome extension version is also available [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LanguageInfo).
- [Arknights YiTuLiu Store Optimizer](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/blob/main/Arknights): annotates and 🏆**prioritises** redeemed event resources on a popular third-party Arknights support site, helping players decide what to redeem first.
- [ICBC Road Test Helper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/ICBC): simplifies the process of booking road tests on Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) website.

### 🐍 Python Scripts 
- [Steam Online Status Checker](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker): a tool using **GitHub Actions** to automatically monitor the status of a Steam user and send updates via Telegram messages.
- [PRTS Scraper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/PRTS-Scraper): a lightweight script to scrape Arknights skill icons using MediaWiki APIs. These icons can later be used to train AI image generators to create new ones.

### 💻 Code Contributions
- [web-clipper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/web-clipper): I contributed to this Google Chrome extension that supports webpage clipping for popular note-taking apps (e.g., OneNote and Notion) by adding support for OneNote note groups. **The [pull request](https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/pull/950) was merged by the original author.**

## 🔬 Research Corner

***A selection of my most meaningful research projects.***

### 📱 Mobile Security
- [UBCBench](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench) [[paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts/2022/10/09529015/1wB2FS12ld6)]: a set of benchmarks for analyzing Android static taint analysis tools.
    - Bug fixes and improvements were merged by their original authors (details [here](https://resess.github.io/artifacts/StaticTaint/ubcbench/#fixed-bugs)).

### 🤖 Image Forensics
- [Shallow- & Deep-fake images localization](https://github.com/zjbthomas/ShallowDeepFakesLocalization) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074246)]: a deep learning solution that effectively localizes modified regions in both shallow- and deep-fake images.

#### *Frenquency-domain Approaches*
- [Frequency-based AI-generated images detection](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqAIDetector) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10221905)]: a deep learning model that detects images generated by Stable Diffusion models using frequency-domain artifacts (>99% accuracy, 🏰 Disney images were used as a case study).
- [Frequency-based AI-generated images attributor](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqGANAttribution) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10855423)]: a frequency-based network that attributes fake images to their source GAN architecture (>95% accuracy).

#### *Sensor-level Approaches*

- [AI-generated images detection using raw images only](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRealOnlyDetector) [paper available soon]: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model for detecting AI-generated images trained using only real/raw images (~94% accuracy).
- [AI-generated images detection by reconstructing raw images](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRecDetetor) [[paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-94962-3_2)]: a method that detects AI-generated images by reconstructing Bayer patterns and comparing statistical differences between real and fake images (~98% accuracy). Notably, this method requires no deep learning.

### 🖼️ Image Generation
- [TMO GAN](https://github.com/zjbthomas/TMO-GAN) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10074176)]: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to produce high-quality 4K High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, significantly improving perceptual quality.
