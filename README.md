# Portfolio
Welcome to my project showcase! This repository serves as a central hub for exploring the tools, scripts, and projects I have developed.

## üéÆ Toy Arcade (Games)

***A collection of fun games I have built.***

- [DukeChess](https://github.com/zjbthomas/DukeChess) [[demo](https://dexaint.itch.io/dukechess)]: a digital adaptation of the chess-inspired board game "The Duke".
    - **Highlighted features**: AI opponent, cross-platform multiplayer support (desktop & web).
    - **Tech stack**: Godot (desktop); React & JavaScript (front-end); Java, Node.js & WebSocket/socket.io (back-end).
- [MemoryDungeon](https://github.com/zjbthomas/MemoryDungeon) [[demo](http://memorydungeon.junbinzhang.com)]: an enhanced version of the traditional memory game, with a roguelike gameplay experience.
    - **Highlighted features**: AI opponent, heroes with unique abilities, and gacha mechanics.
    - **Tech stack**: Godot & Qt in C++ (desktop).
- [LinkWord](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LinkWord): a lightweight Chinese word-chain game.
    - **Tech stack**: Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Toy Workshop (Scripts)

***Handy scripts I have crafted to make life easier.***

### üêµ Tampermonkey Userscripts (JavaScript) 
- [Steam Wishlist Language Highlighter](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/SteamLanguage): highlights games in a user's Steam wishlist that lack support for specific languages.
    - Language information is retrieved using a **Python** script [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker/blob/main/steam_language.py) as a **GitHub Actions** workflow. 
    - A Google Chrome extension version is also available [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LanguageInfo).
- [Arknights YiTuLiu Store Optimizer](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/blob/main/Arknights): annotates and optimizes redeemed event resources on a popular third-party Arknights support site, helping players decide what to redeem first.
- [ICBC Road Test Helper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/ICBC): simplifies the process of booking road tests on Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) website.

### üêç Python Scripts 
- [Steam Online Status Checker](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker): a tool using **GitHub Actions** to automatically monitor the status of a Steam user and send updates via Telegram messages.
- [PRTS Scraper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/PRTS-Scraper): a lightweight script to scrape Arknights skill icons using MediaWiki APIs. These icons can later be used to train AI image generators to create new ones.

### üíª Code Contributions
- [web-clipper](https://github.com/zjbthomas/web-clipper): I contributed to this Google Chrome extension that supports webpage clipping for popular note-taking apps (e.g., OneNote and Notion) by adding support for OneNote note groups. The [pull request](https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/pull/950) was merged by the original author.

## üî¨ Research Corner

***A selection of my most meaningful research projects.***

### üì± Mobile Security
- [UBCBench](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench) [[paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts/2022/10/09529015/1wB2FS12ld6)]: a set of benchmarks for analyzing Android static taint analysis tools.
    - Bug fixes and improvements were merged by their original authors (details [here](https://resess.github.io/artifacts/StaticTaint/ubcbench/#fixed-bugs)).

### ü§ñ Image Forensics
- [Shallow- & Deep-fake images localization](https://github.com/zjbthomas/ShallowDeepFakesLocalization) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074246)]: a deep learning solution that effectively localizes modified regions in both shallow- and deep-fake images.

#### Frenquency-domain Approaches
- [Frequency-based AI-generated images detection](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqAIDetector) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10221905)]: a deep learning model that detects images generated by Stable Diffusion models using frequency-domain artifacts (>99% accuracy). Disney images were used as a case study.
- [Frequency-based AI-generated images attributor](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqGANAttribution) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10855423)]: a frequency-based network for finding that attributes fake images to their source GAN architecture (>95% accuracy).

#### Sensor-level Approaches

- [AI-generated images detection using raw images only](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRealOnlyDetector) [paper available soon]: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model for detecting AI-generated images trained using only real/raw images (~94% accuracy).
- [AI-generated images detection by reconstructing raw images](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRecDetetor) [[paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-94962-3_2)]: a method that detects AI-generated images by reconstructing images and comparing statistical differences between real and fake images (~98% accuracy). Notably, this method requires no deep learning.

### üñºÔ∏è Image Generation
- [TMO GAN](https://github.com/zjbthomas/TMO-GAN) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10074176)]: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to produce high-quality 4K High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, significantly improving perceptual quality.
