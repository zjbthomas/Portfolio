## üõ†Ô∏è Toy Workshop (Scripts)

***Handy scripts I have crafted to make life easier.***

### üêµ Tampermonkey Userscripts (JavaScript) 
- [**Steam Wishlist Language Highlighter**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/SteamLanguage): highlights games in a user's Steam wishlist that lack support for specific languages.
    - Language information is retrieved using a **Python** script [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker/blob/main/steam_language.py) as a **GitHub Actions** workflow. 
    - A Google Chrome extension version is also available [here](https://github.com/zjbthomas/LanguageInfo).
- [**Arknights YiTuLiu Store Optimizer**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/blob/main/Arknights): annotates and üèÜ**prioritizes** redeemed event resources on a popular third-party Arknights support site, helping players decide what to redeem first.
- [**ICBC Road Test Helper**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/Tampermonkey/tree/main/ICBC): simplifies the process of booking road tests on Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) website.

### üêç Python Scripts 
- [**Steam Online Status Checker**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/SteamOnlineChecker): a tool using **GitHub Actions** to automatically monitor the status of a Steam user and send updates via Telegram messages.
- [**PRTS Scraper**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/PRTS-Scraper): a lightweight script to scrape Arknights skill icons using MediaWiki APIs. These icons can later be used to train AI image generators to create new ones.

### üíª Code Contributions
- [**web-clipper**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/web-clipper): I contributed to this Google Chrome extension that supports webpage clipping for popular note-taking apps (e.g., OneNote, Notion) by adding support for OneNote note groups. **The [pull request](https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/pull/950) was merged by the original author.**

## üî¨ Research Corner

***A selection of my most meaningful research projects.***

### ü§ñ Image Forensics
- [**Shallow- & Deep-fake images localization**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/ShallowDeepFakesLocalization) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074246)]: a deep learning solution that effectively localizes modified regions in both shallow- and deep-fake images.

#### *Frenquency-domain Approaches*
- [**Frequency-based AI-generated images detection**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqAIDetector) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10221905)]: a deep learning model that detects images generated by Stable Diffusion models using frequency-domain artifacts (>99% accuracy, üè∞ Disney images were used as a case study).
- [**Frequency-based AI-generated images attribution**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/FreqGANAttribution) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10855423)]: a frequency-based network that attributes fake images to their source GAN architecture (>95% accuracy).

#### *Sensor-level Approaches*

- [**AI-generated images detection trained with raw images only**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRealOnlyDetector) [paper available soon]: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model for detecting AI-generated images trained using only real/raw images (~94% accuracy).
- [**AI-generated images detection by reconstructing raw images**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/BayerRecDetetor) [[paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-94962-3_2)]: a method that detects AI-generated images by reconstructing Bayer patterns and comparing statistical differences between real and fake images (~98% accuracy). Notably, this method requires no deep learning.

### üì± Mobile Security
- [**UBCBench**](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench) [[paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts/2022/10/09529015/1wB2FS12ld6)]: a set of benchmarks for analyzing Android static taint analysis tools.
    - Bug fixes and improvements were merged by their original authors (details [here](https://resess.github.io/artifacts/StaticTaint/ubcbench/#fixed-bugs)).
- [**Android OAuth vulnerability analysis**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/OAuthUsage) [[report](https://github.com/zjbthomas/OAuthUsage/blob/main/report.pdf)]: a course project that investigates security risks in Android applications using the OAuth protocol.
- [**Android password leakage detection**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/EECE512) [[report](https://github.com/zjbthomas/EECE512/blob/master/report.pdf)]: a course project that detects potential password leakage in Android applications using the *FlowDroid* framework, a static analysis tool.

### üñºÔ∏è Image Generation
- [**TMO GAN**](https://github.com/zjbthomas/TMO-GAN) [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10074176)]: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to produce high-quality 4K High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, significantly improving perceptual quality.

## üåê Website Creations

***Websites I have built or contributed to.***

- [**University of British Columbia, Digital Multimedia Lab**](https://dml.ece.ubc.ca/): I designed and currently maintain the website for my Ph.D. research lab, built on the [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com/) framework. I customized the framework to meet specific lab requirements:
    - Publications are categorized into finer-grained types (e.g., conference papers, journal articles), and the search function was rewritten to work within each category.
    - By adding new metadata to page elements, lab members can easily redirect to their own departmental web pages.
    - Embedded website statistics by modifying the universal footer.
- [**BC Liquor Store Explorer**](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2018-19/hw08-zjbthomas) [[demo](https://junbinzhang.shinyapps.io/junbinzhang-bcl/)]: a course project web app that allows users to explore BC Liquor products with filters such as price, type, and country.
    - **Highlighted features**: interactive search and filtering, data visualization with Shiny.
    - **Tech Stack**: R, Shiny
